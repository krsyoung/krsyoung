## What is this?

This document exists thanks to a talk given by Alex Witherspoon to the #digitalAF team in 2021. The idea 
is to create a document that explains myself the world of work. Basically to humanize myself, something 
I'd like to avoid :-) It probably also doubles as a way to explain myself to ... myself ...

I've blogged about my take on this in more detail on [why Harled values Human User Guides](https://harled.ca/blog/why_we_value_human_user_guides).

## About Me

I live in Kitchener, ON. I'm a father of three. I used to play a lot of fastpitch softball (and pretty much any other type of softball). I love baseball hats. I also used to skateboard. 

I have always loved computers. This career choice has never felt like work. I feel like I'm an introvert who can manage myself to be social as necessary. I still like to play PC games with friends.

## Personal Principles and Values

I believe in:

1. Loving what you do.
2. Striving for pragmatic perfection in all areas.
3. Holding yourself accountable. 
4. Acting as a team, delivering as a team and celebrating as a team. Each member lifts the team up.
5. I expect a lot of you, but I'll never expect more of you than I expect of myself.
6. Digging deep when necessary.
7. Leaders should lead by doing and setting the example.

## One-on-ones

I like chatting, mentoring and problem solving. I don't like (don't excel) at typical "HR" style 1:1s.
If I forget to ask you how you are doing, it isn't because I don't care (I promise you that I do), it 
is because I'm so excited to get down to the technical stuff. A weakness I need to overcome.

I appreciate when you come to a meeting with a topic and have clearly invested some time into solving /
evaluating it on your own.

I have a lot of opinions. They are just that.

## Teamwork Preferences

I like it when I'm not the only one talking. I like learning interesting things from other people. I 
need somebody to help me share the floor (an awkward silence gets me every time). I lived in NY for long 
enough that I will happily overtalk you and think nothing of it. 

A winning team is a fun team for me.

## Technical Preferences

I love tech. All tech. My focus is mostly on just enough tech to satisfy a business need. It has been a while (forever?) since I wrote a "real" CS algorithm. I really like Ruby on Rails. 

When coding, I like to explore solutions dynamically. Basically experiment with code while solving the problem 
interactively (i.e. `debugger` / `rails console`).

I know enough about most things. I know a lot about very few things.

Some things I've explored in my day: 

Mac OS 7, Fedora, PHP, DB2, bash, perl, Ruby on Rails, OpenSUSE, RHEL, SLES, z/VM, System z, python, Turbogears, REXX, TCL, Java, System P, AIX, IBM Bluemix, AWS, Digital Ocean, Docker, go, Erlang/Elixir/Phoenix, Vue, Node.js, Azure, Angular.

## Feedback

I appreciate timely and relevant feedback. I appreciate people who take the time to formulate it in a way 
that is actionable and understandable.

I appreciate feedback that is anchored in being the best and doing the best.

Feel free to PR here to:

a) let me know something I've got wrong
b) let me know something else that is overwhelmingly me that I've missed!

## Things That *Really* Bug Me

1. Having to ask twice.
2. Preaching without action.
3. Poor communication.

## Other Thoughts

I'm not really sure how to categorize this information, other than I believe it strongly! It summarized 
my take and how I evaluate the progression of an individual over time. Academic representing the most 
junior level of understanding (even if very deep) and opinionated representing the most senior level 
of understanding.

When interviewing with me, I LOVE to see somebody being opinionated. Take a stance and back it up.

**Academic** - something that has been studied, learned from books for videos and is conceptually understood.

**Experiential** - something that has been done, in a meaningful context.

**Opinionated** - something that has been done many times, many ways and a strong opinion has been formed.
