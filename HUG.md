## What is this?

This document exists thanks to a talk given by Alex Witherspoon to the #digitalAF team in 2021. The idea 
is to create a document that explains me to the world of work. Basically to humanize myself, something 
I'd like to avoid :-) It probably also doubles as a way to explain myself to myself ...

## About Me

I live in Kitchener, ON. I'm a father of two. I used to play a lot of fastpitch softball (and pretty much any other type of softball). I love baseball hats. I also used to skateboard. 

I have always loved computers. This career choice has never ever felt like work. I feel like I'm an introvert who can manage myself to be social as necessary. I still like to play PC games with friends.

## Personal Principles and Values

I believe in:

1. Loving what you do.
2. Striving for pragmatic perfection in all areas.
3. Holding yourself accountable. 
4. Acting as a team, delivering as a team and celebrating as a team. Each member props the team up.
5. I expect a lot of you but I'll never expect more of you than I expect of myself.
6. Digging deep when necessary.

## One-on-ones

I like chatting, mentoring and problem solving. I don't like (don't excel) at typical "HR" style 1:1s.

I appreciate when you come to a meeting with a topic and have clearly invested some time into solving /
evaluating it on your own.

I have a lot of opinions. They are just that.

## Teamwork Preferences

I like it when I'm not the only one talking. I like learning interesting things from other people. I 
need somebody to help me share the floor (an awkward silence gets me every time). I lived in NY for long 
enough that I will happily overtalk you and think nothing of it. 

A winning team is a fun team for me.

## Technical Preferences

I love tech. All tech. My focus is mostly on just enough tech to satisfy a business need. It has been a while (forever?) since I wrote a "real" CS algorithm. I really like Ruby on Rails. 

When coding, I like to explore solutions dynamically. Basically experiment with code while solving the problem 
interactively (i.e. `byebug` / `rails console`).

I know enough about most things. I know a lot about very few things.

Some things I've explored in my day: 

Mac OS 7, Fedora, PHP, DB2, bash, perl, Ruby on Rails, OpenSUSE, RHEL, SLES, z/VM, System z, python, Turbogears, REXX, TCL, Java, System P, AIX, IBM Bluemix, AWS, Digital Ocean, Docker, go, Erlang/Elixir/Phoenix, Vue, Node.js, Azure, Angular.

## Feedback

I appreciate timely and relevant feedback. I appreciate people who take the time to formulate it in a way 
that is actionable and understandable.

I appreciate feedback that is anchored in being the best and doing the best.

Feel free to PR here to:

a) let me know something I've got wrong
b) let me know something else that is overwhelmingly me that I've missed!
